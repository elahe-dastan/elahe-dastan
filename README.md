I'm currently studying computer engineering at [Amirkabir University Of Technology](https://aut.ac.ir/) and looking <br/>forward to study AI in the future.<br/>
My favorite programming language is [golang](https://golang.org/), I have experience in Java and python3 too. I have joined [Snapp](https://snapp.ir/) and work<br/>

Fun fact: I do love lollipop.
